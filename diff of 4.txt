The people were friendly but maybe they need to be given an espresso drink before starting their shift, Sunday's are always busy so they should be prepared for a fast phased environment. 4 staff only 1 making drinks, 1 taking front counter, orders and 1 in drive thru. Management should suggest possibly having crew members that are just standing at registers to make the items their waiting on so customers aren't waiting 20 min for 1 coffee in an empty lobby while drive thru is getting the only service.\

This Starbucks is actually one of the hardest working Starbucks I've been to. Nikki (the manager) is always thinking of the customer idk what these other prissy little women are talking about. The baristas there are really great and if you ever get ignored it's most likely because you're a creepy pervy guy hitting on them because that is the only reason any of these baristas will ignore you. Drive thru is as fast or slow as the people in line make it. Some people like to change their orders while they have 4 cars in front of them. I had to get that out of the way because the ignorance and self appointed importance some of these people bestow onto themselves irritates me. I know basically all of the partners that work there and they are all very professional and friendly. One of the shifts there Ashley knows how to make a lot of different frapaccinnos and drinks that aren't on the menu so if you kindly ask her she'll surprise you with an amazing drink. I think there should be more managers like Nikki she not only cares about the customer but all the baristas as well. I find it very hard to believe she is ever nasty to anyone because she isn't even rude to her employees. There is another barista there her name is Selena and she is one of the most hardworking baristas I've met. I've seen a review on here about how she took 10 minutes to make a chai and that a baristas life is so hard and honestly sometimes it can be a big bitch having to deal with rude Asa customers, keeping a smile on your face, and getting everything done on time before closing. She is human too so if she forgets that you exist don't be such a timid brat and say something if you're not a rude bitch about it.  You'll have your chai soon enough. Cleaning is a big part of the night crew so yeah they kind of busy their ass cleaning the stuff they use to make your drinks so be considerate and polite when coming in and you'll probably never be disappointed because Selena and all the other baristas really do try to be as kind and consistent as possible with their customer service. Take this review as it is and go in there and find out yourself.\

You just have to love Starbucks, always busy. So don't hate that a cup of coffee cost so much. Just stay at home and be a hater.\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
It is scary as I sit here and watch people come in the door.. Do they put something in the coffee that is addictive ??? Or is it just that good ??? Either way I do notice that they are all not made the same.. But I still feel the need that I MUST have my coffee. Staff can range from store to store but for the most part are always curtious. Wish I had came up with the concept to start a company like Starbucks $$$\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
I only went through the drive thur only.  I was in dying for some sugar!!!  I ordered a Venti ice blended vanilla frat no coffee with whipped cream.  My energy levels were shutting down.\
\
5 mins:  Drove up, place my order, got my drink the way I want, and drove off as a happy camper.\
\
I am re-charged so no poor soul is going to pay for my hangry mood.  LOL!\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
Sorry, as long as the service is good, I am a pathetic Starbucks-a-holic.\

THIS STORE IS CLOSED...they relocated down the street to the corner of Clague & Lorain.\

Love Starbucks... but have to say the Key Man parking signs in the lot have ruined it for me.  Key Man has way to many parking spots and needs to be lenient when they have a tons of spots free and Starbucks has none. Don't park or you will get booted- not worth the $50 fee to get free.\

Love Starbuck but   hate    the parking situation...\
\
Also see the BBB and what has been going on for years.  The Key Man spots had tons of free spots available, and I agree that if the lot was full- then it makes sense to ticket.  The lot was not full so they should be friendly to their neighbors...  wow what a concept.\

I've always had a good experience at this Starbucks. I live basically right next door so I come here a lot and usually go through the Drive Thru and I've never had any issues. The staff here is really friendly and I like friendly people. \
\
One thing though and this has to do with the customers not with Starbucks....if you are in the drive thru line with more than 2 cars behind you...YOU'RE IN TOO DEEP...don't try and "back out" of the drive thru because that is obnoxious. Also, do not PARK directly behind the drive through on a week day morning because YOU WON"T BE ABLE TO GET OUT. Literally, some dude came out to his car one time and he was parked directly behind the super busy drive thru and laid on his horn for literally like 5 minutes. WTF do you think that's gonna do you FOOL. Sorry you made a really terrible parking choice but don't punish the rest of us.\

I was quite dismayed to read a review about an employee that has provided outstanding service for the past 6+ years.  I am a daily or even twice daily customer and Joan is always pleasant, friendly, and helpful.  It is management that should have gotten the bad review.  The bathrooms are typically quite disgusting and I have mentioned it several times, to no avail.  It also seems as though they are constantly understaffed, with long wait times for drinks to be made.  Just because one customer had a bad day, doesn't make a good employee bad.\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
I love their service! Mobile order is the way to go with this Starbucks since they don't have a drive thru. You get skip the line and will get greeted by your name by their morning employees if you happen to become a regular. I wouldn't recommend trying to get work or studying done unless during mid afternoon. There is not enough space and it seem chaotic during busy times.\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
The only reason why I even bother to review large chains like Starbucks is EXCEPTIONAL service.  After all, we all know what to expect from drinks/food at these places.\
\
The blonde lady who took my order was friendly and extremely passionate about a certain line of drinks, so I just went with her suggestion.  It was as though the rest of the menu didn't even exist!  She also didn't rush me along - although it wasn't terribly busy during the time of my visit (early Saturday morning).\
\
Parking lot can be a bit of a pain, since there's a somewhat confusing 3-way stop sign, Costco gas station, Walmart all within the same complex.\
\
BONUS:  Outdoor seating...if you're into that sort of thing.  No umbrellas though, so it's rather exposed!\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
I love this place and the new look inside...  Coffee is the same, it's Starbucks people...!   But seriously, do something about the brutally slow internet....  : (\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
Envision this: you wake up on a Monday morning with a late start because your keys were stuck in the cracks of your sofa and it wasn't till an hour of looking you decided to literally pull apart the house, including your sofa. Ah. There you are, damn keys.\
\
Walk out the door with your cup of home brewed coffee that got cold amidst the chaos of your lost keys. You trip on the Welcome rug outside your door because the storm the previous night was strong enough to create a wrinkle in the rug. Your coffee goes everywhere. And of course you are wearing a white blouse. *insert profanity here*\
\
Finally, after exchanging shirts and trashing the coffee, you decide you have 10 minutes to get some fresh coffee from the Starbucks down the road. Making you only 15 minutes late to work.\
\
Of course you hit every red light on the way. It's a Monday and you can't deny the fact that the planet is planning your demise this very moment.\
\
But you get to this Starbucks drive thru and you get Bob over the intercom, so happy and delightful. Completely swaying your opinion to your animosity of Monday's.\
\
First thing he does while handing you your coffee, "It's on the house today, you come here enough to deserve a free one!!!" (Or something to that derivative.)\
\
The world does have compassion. Even on a Monday.\

cool place. \

and these from other reviewer not me.\
\
The wait for the drive thru on a Sunday morning at 9:00 was pretty brutal.  The woman in front of us in the drive thru was, just by watching her actions, quite.... scatterbrained?  Let's just say every interaction with the cashier/drive through window worker was long winded and seemed to\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
The one by the apple store is always the fastest and the staff is super fun and friendly!   I am always so appalled how rude customers are though.    Give the people working there a break and if you have a hissy fit because you have to wait 2 mins for your food or coffee then you have bigger issues.\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
My Starbucks card had just been reloaded with money on it a few days ago.   The money wasn't showing up, so the cashier gave me the peppermint mocha for free.  I will email Starbucks corporate to resolve the problem.  Gotta get my daily SB FIX.  Today is a peppermint mocha frap.\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
Brand new Starbucks is open! But don't tell anybody, I want to keep it to myself. After today I probably won't be able to get a seat in here. This store replaces the Starbucks at 7000 E. Mayo (Scottsdale Rd & Mayo). And they have nitro cold brew coffee here, if that's your thing. As the great patriot Patrick Henry would say: "Give me latte or give me death!"\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
CLOSED PERMANENTLY?!? The Safeway this Starbucks is in burnt down last night (7/11/2018) in a massive fire. The building is a total loss. Thankfully everyone got out ok and no injuries or deaths. Hopefully the company will rebuild. Just sad that all the employees are now out of work.\
----------------------------------REVIEW----------------------------------\
Closed up. Everything gone. This was in a horrible location. Not sure if another will pop up across the street where BMO was ordered finally located. With Tim's in that area it's unlikely.\
