      "This Starbucks is actually one of the hardest working Starbucks I've been to. Nikki (the manager) is always thinking of the customer idk what these other prissy little women are talking about. The baristas there are really great and if you ever get ignored it's most likely because you're a creepy pervy guy hitting on them because that is the only reason any of these baristas will ignore you. Drive thru is as fast or slow as the people in line make it. Some people like to change their orders while they have 4 cars in front of them. I had to get that out of the way because the ignorance and self appointed importance some of these people bestow onto themselves irritates me. I know basically all of the partners that work there and they are all very professional and friendly. One of the shifts there Ashley knows how to make a lot of different frapaccinnos and drinks that aren't on the menu so if you kindly ask her she'll surprise you with an amazing drink. I think there should be more managers like Nikki she not only cares about the customer but all the baristas as well. I find it very hard to believe she is ever nasty to anyone because she isn't even rude to her employees. There is another barista there her name is Selena and she is one of the most hardworking baristas I've met. I've seen a review on here about how she took 10 minutes to make a chai and that a baristas life is so hard and honestly sometimes it can be a big bitch having to deal with rude Asa customers, keeping a smile on your face, and getting everything done on time before closing. She is human too so if she forgets that you exist don't be such a timid brat and say something if you're not a rude bitch about it.  You'll have your chai soon enough. Cleaning is a big part of the night crew so yeah they kind of busy their ass cleaning the stuff they use to make your drinks so be considerate and polite when coming in and you'll probably never be disappointed because Selena and all the other baristas really do try to be as kind and consistent as possible with their customer service. Take this review as it is and go in there and find out yourself.\n",
